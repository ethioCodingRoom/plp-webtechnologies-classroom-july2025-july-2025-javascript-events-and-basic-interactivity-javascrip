# EthioCodingRoom | Interactive Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This project demonstrates essential concepts of **interactive web development with JavaScript**. It is a personal portfolio website for **Asres Gamu Yelia** and features a dynamic registration form for the **EthioCodingRoom Bootcamp**.

The main objectives were to enhance user experience by implementing JavaScript-based event handling, DOM manipulation, and client-side form validation.

## What I Covered

### ðŸŽ® Part 1: Event Handling

- Used `addEventListener()` to handle user interactions
- Applied `mouseover` and `mouseout` events on navigation links to change their style dynamically

### Part 2: Interactive Elements

- Created a **"Show More About Me"** button that toggles extra information in the **About Me** section
- Dynamically manipulated the DOM to add and remove elements based on user actions

### Part 3: Form Validation

- Built custom client-side validation logic for the bootcamp registration form
- Checked the following before form submission:
  - Full Name: minimum 3 characters
  - Email: valid format
  - Phone: digits only, at least 10 characters
  - Location: cannot be empty
  - Interest: must be selected
- Displayed friendly error messages without reloading the page
